# Main-Project

Group Member: Gabrielle Cervantes, Wendy Chew, Megan Dittamore

This project will be built using the MediaWiki platform, as it is a highly accessible tool to create a forum like the one we have in mind.
This will easily allow for international participation, and simplifies decisions pertaining to layout and design of the website, 
as we will be following the Wiki formatting.
